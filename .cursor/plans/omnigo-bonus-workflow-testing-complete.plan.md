### 4. Testing Infrastructure

- ✅ Added test scripts to package.json (test, test:watch, test:ui)
- ✅ Created unit tests for bonus calculations
(at src/services/bonus-workflow-service.test.ts)
- ✅ All 5 tests passing

### 5. TypeScript Types & Schemas

- ✅ Updated `updateBonusWorkflowSchema` to include consultant selection
- ✅ Proper type inference throughout

## Test Coverage

The test file covers:
1. Net bonus calculation with advance deduction (3111 - 500 = 2611)
2. Negative net bonus when advance exceeds bonus
3. Null advance handling (treated as zero)
4. Email format validation with advance
5. Email format validation without advance

## Architecture Decision

**Single Consultant Selection**: The implementation uses a simpler approach where only ONE consultant is selected to receive the Omnigo bonus per cycle. This matches the business requirement that the Omnigo client provides a single bonus amount to be distributed to one consultant.

**Advance Deduction Logic**: When a consultant has a `bonusAdvance` on their line item, the system automatically deducts it from the omnigoBonus to show the net payment amount in the email.
