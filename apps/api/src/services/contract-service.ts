RECITALS 
A. VSol is a software development company specializing in software consulting, and has made a 
substantial investment of time, effort and expense to establish and develop its business, its 
goodwill, its products, its customer and supplier relationships, and to preserve and protect its 
Confidential Information (as defined below).  
B. THE_CONSULTANT is a software service provider that desires to provide certain services and 
deliverables to VSol. 
C. VSol desires to engage THE_CONSULTANT to provide certain services and deliverables to VSol, 
as agreed to by the Parties.  
NOW, THEREFORE, the Parties agree as follows: 
1. SERVICES. During the Term (as defined below) THE_CONSULTANT shall provide the 
professional services ("Services") as agreed to by the Parties. The Parties will agree to (i) a 
reasonably detailed description of the Services to be performed and any Deliverables 
(defined below) to be provided; (ii) an estimated schedule and completion date; (iii) the 
identity of the employees who THE_CONSULTANT reasonably anticipates will perform the 
Services; (iv) an acceptance procedure for the Services rendered, if applicable; (v) a 
compensation and payment schedule; and (vi) any other items that either VSol or 
THE_CONSULTANT may require. The terms and conditions in this Agreement shall govern 
THE_CONSULTANT's provision of Services and Deliverables under the Agreement.   
a. Exportation of your services. THE_CONSULTANT shall provide services directly to VSol, a 
registered Florida company. Your services will be consumed by our clients located in the 
United States and throughout the world and must NOT be performed from within the 
United States. Your services must be performed by you and must NOT be performed by a 
US Person, as this term is defined by governing US law. 
b. Deliverables. "Deliverables" means the software, source code, object code, products, 
modifications, improvements, reports, videos, documents, templates, studies, strategies, 
specifications, summaries, charts, drawings, manuals, documentation, ideas, concepts, 
techniques, processes or works of authorship developed or created by THE_CONSULTANT 
for VSol in performing the Services under this Agreement, including any Intellectual 
Property Rights. "Intellectual Property Rights" means, on a world-wide basis, any (i) 
copyrights, moral rights, mask works, and all derivatives; (ii) trade secret or other 
confidential information rights; (iii) any patentable material or ideas, including patents, 
patent applications, and related applications; (iv) trademarks, trade name rights and 
similar rights and associated goodwill; and (v) intellectual and industrial property rights, 
of every kind and nature throughout the world and however designated. All Deliverables 
are deemed a "Work For Hire" within the meaning of the United States Copyright Act, 17 
U.S.C. ยง 101. To the extent that the Deliverables are not found to be "Works Made For 
Hire," THE_CONSULTANT irrevocably assigns, transfers and conveys, and will cause its 
personnel to assign, transfer and convey to VSol without further consideration, all of their 
rights, title, and interest in and to such Deliverables, including all Intellectual Property 
Rights. THE_CONSULTANT agrees that it will cooperate with VSol in executing documents 
or providing any other assistance to THE_CONSULTANT required for THE_CONSULTANT 
to protect its legal rights in the Deliverables. All Deliverables shall be the sole and 
exclusive property of THE_CONSULTANT and shall be provided without any liens, 
encumbrances or security interests, unless expressly agreed otherwise by the Parties in 
writing.   
2. FEES & REIMBURSEMENT & PAYMENT SYSTEMS.  
a. VSol shall: (i) pay THE_CONSULTANT the fees agreed to by the Parties forty-five (45) days 
from receipt of an undisputed invoice; and (ii) reimburse such expenses as 
THE_CONSULTANT reasonably incurs in provision of the Services, provided VSol has 
approved any such expenses in advance.  
b. THE_CONSULTANT will use client software from TimeDoctor.com to enter time worked, 
or paid time off (when entering time off is applicable). Please be advised that TimeDoctor 
has screen monitoring, URL monitoring and other monitoring capability that may 
POTENTIALLY be used on your user account without prior notice to you.  
c. Use of Payoneer or any other method of transferring money from VSol to 
THE_CONSULTANT. You agree that the values will be calculated in the agreed upon value 
and currency, but will be then converted to the currency used by the FinTech system, in 
the case of Payoneer US Dolar. This value may be lower or higher than number of hours 
paid, times the agreed upon hourly salary value in the currency agreed upon. You will not 
seek reimbursement or pay back credit to VSol for this difference of value between value 
of hours registered in TimeDoctor and value deposited in Payoneer account in USD. This 
fluctuation of values has already been accounted for in the value negotiated with 
THE_CONSULTANT priorly and no monies will be owed by either party.  
3. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Confidential 
Information" shall include all information about a Party's operations and business, employees, 
agents, contractors, subsidiaries or affiliates, whether written or oral, that is either non-public, 
confidential or proprietary in nature, whether or not such information is marked or described as

subpoena or other process or requirement of law to disclose the Confidential Information,

such disclosure requirement so that the other Party may, at its option and expense, seek 
a protective order or other appropriate remedy to prevent or limit the disclosure of the 
Confidential Information.

Party owns their own Confidential Information provided under this Agreement and agree
